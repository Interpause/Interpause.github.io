Reading Guide &amp; Recitation Qn - Durkheim v.2022 sep.pdf]]\n#NOTE 2023-10-08: Refactor using full graph technique in prep for exam\nWE LIVE IN A SOCIETY; INTERDEPENDENCE; HARMONY; COMPLEMENTARY DIFFERENCES; SOLIDARITY; MERITOCRACY; AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\n\nDurkeim - Father of Sociology\n\nStudy Society from the macro rather than micro level\nBelieves Law &amp; Morality are societal constructs rather than instrinsic\nWas interested in Solidarity: What holds society together\n\nDid not properly account for the nature of conflict in society or between societies\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/Spaces/SUTD Academics/02.003 Social Science/4 - Structural Functionalism/#social-facts\">#Social Facts</a> - Facts which explain societal behaviour from a societal level\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/Spaces/SUTD Academics/02.003 Social Science/4 - Structural Functionalism/#moral-facts\">#Moral Facts</a> - Facts about moral behaviour. What we &quot;should&quot; do as part of society\nSocial &amp; moral rules are different things too\nWhile Division of Labour typically plays an Economic Role, its Moral Role is to unite society in solidarity through interdependence\n\nLater, he also argues it promotes freedom by rejecting <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/Spaces/SUTD Academics/02.003 Social Science/4 - Structural Functionalism/#mechanical-solidarity\">#Mechanical Solidarity</a>'s collective uniformity\nJ-H: Did Durkheim miss out improving Standard of Living (SoL) as a moral fact?\n\nDivision of Labour -&gt; Exchange -&gt; Interdependence -&gt; Solidarity\n\nMarriage as an example of how such interdependence can be moral &amp; beautiful rather than &quot;crippling&quot; (as Marx says)\nOr the different stereotypes within a friend group\n\nTo ease understanding, social relationships can be more appropiately thought of as social interactions\n\nSuch interactions, be it exchange or marriage, are governable by law when important\nUnimportant or rare interactions are govern by social norm (custom)\n\nLaw is only developed when there is a society, and society only forms when there is solidarity; Hence law serves as a way to measure solidarity\n\nThough its possible Law creates solidarity, or its a loop where solidarity creates law which creates more solidarity\nFor example, the NS Act creates the common experience of NS, increasing mechanical solidarity\n\nJ-H: IMO Collective Consciousness is a matter of Culture. Collective Consciousness at the level of a society's average culture determines society's morals, but sub-cultures of a society may deviate from the common.\n\nA real problem is when sub-cultures not only deviate, but start to conflict on society's moral.\n\nOne social phenomena that causes this is polarisation.\n\nJ-H: Important to note. Durkheim believes the strength of the Collective Consciousness is dependent on Mechanical to Organic. It is your own opinion that Collective Consciousness doesn't change in strength, but rather in tolerance &amp; generality.\nJ-H: Is Durkheim the first globalist?\n\nAs society develops, we shift from mechanical to organic. The focus of morality shifts from uniformity to ensuring the smooth functioning interdependence. Interdependence implies that we have different roles &amp; are no longer uniform.\nLecture\n#NOTE 2023-10-02: Darn, need to check if these concepts are present in the presentation page ranges, cause it feels missing.\n\nNational Education/Day creates bonds; is a form of positive solidarity\nEducation teaches how to behave in society beyond just academics\n\n&quot;â€¦education sets out precisely with the object of creating a social being&quot;\n\nInterdependent relationships formed through work is how solidarity is provided in a society where individuals are increasingly different\nEstablishing social norms help to maintain social solidarity\nMeritocracy\nPrimary question: &quot;How does it come about that the individual, whilst becoming more autonomous, depends ever more closely upon society?&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 7)\nSocial fact: &quot;Which is general over the whole of a given society whilst having an existence of its own, independent of its individual manifestations.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 59)\n\nSocial facts exert influence (extrinsic) over all members of society, or are otherwise intrinsic to all members such that its general\nTo go against a social fact means you would be outcast by society typically\nIs this the same as social norms\n\n&quot;Moral facts are phenomena like any others. Thney consist of rules for action that are recognizable by certain distinct characteristics. Since morality for us is a system of facts that have been realized, linked to the total world system, it cannot survive if it does not serve a purpose or correspond to some need.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 3)\n\nAll moral facts should correspond to some societal purpose or need.\nMoral facts are actually a subset of Social facts\nUnlike social norms, which may not be moral &amp; hence only invite disgust if broken, moral facts invite retribution if broken\n\nThe state, representative of the collective, can only enforce laws because &quot;there exists no moral force superior to that of the individual, save that of the collectivity&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 67)\n\nSolidarity can only be achieved when crime is punished to show its untolerated;\n\nThis is actually to make citizens of society feel safe that such behaviours are untolerated, hence keep solidarity\n\nPositive Solidarity: brings out integration/bonding in society, Negative Solidarity: Does the opposite\n\nNegative Solidarity is not a bad thing, its neutral in that it sometimes must occur for moral reasons\n\nSolidarity from Common Consciousness\n\nJ-H: You keep mixing this up. Remember, Durkheim believes Common Consciousness weakens, so he uses that as the term for everyone being uniform. So instead of saying conforming to common sentiments, or uniformity, just say Common Consciousness is the source of solidarity\n\nDivision of Labour is like marriage\nAnomie: Normlessness, where there is no cohesion or regulation (no social norms); A Pathological Condition\n\nInequality/disharmony by exploitation, misallocation of individuals to castes\n\nThe normal state should be meritocracy\nExact reciprocity in the services exchanges; aka fair trade\n\nLimitations of Durkheim's arguments\n\nOnly focused on national level; didnt show if it really applies to global although he claims of world government\nFails to examine what happens when there are too much regulations\nFails to examine the nature of conflict &amp; prove it will really resolve itself\n\nOr that in such cases, the individual rights will prevail\n\nCurrent Affair Example: Hollywood Strike\n\nEven if the global pie grows, the pie of dying industries will shrink\n\nFunctionalist Mindset\n\nViews society as a system of interrelated parts\n\n&quot;The whole must be given priority because its influence is greater than that of a single part.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 362)\n\nSystems naturally equilibrate\nFocus on social order as the most impt metric to maintain\nInstitutions/Social structures are what drives Societal Development\n\n&quot;The more widespread an institution, the more lasting and profound the need to which it corresponds&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 365)\n\nSociety's needs are reliant on institutions that govern them\n\nConsensus is the ultimate basis of social order\n\n&quot;Social life is above all a harmonious community of endeavours, when minds and will come together to work for the same aim&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 363)\n\nStructural Functionalism\n\nStructures that maintain the stability of society include: households, political systems, economic systems, education &amp; laws\n\nStructures are added and removed as society deems necessary\nFor example Industrialization replaced Slavery for the purpose of production\n\nSlavery lost its purpose\n\nMaintain order &amp; keep society functioning\nSociety can be out of balance during upheavals or rapid change as social norms &amp; laws have yet to form to regulate interactions and promote peace &amp; cooperation (Anomie)\n\nHave to reinstate norms &amp; structures before equilibrium can be re-achieved\n\nThe collectivity trumps and is more impt than the individual\nMaintain objective perspective while analyzing relationships between functional groups/social structures/institutions of society\nWhat is moral isnt the researcher's opinion, its what the society deems as moral (this can be objectively measured via surveys for example)\n\nSo we are looking at whether homosexuality is moral to a society, rather than whether its inherently moral\nThough, as durkheim claims the collectivity is the most impt, ultimately, society is the determining factor of morality for him\n\nShould study society from the outside, rather than based on own personal experiences; Done by viewing collectivity as a separate entity to yourself\n\nSocial facts, Institutions &amp; the law are some examples of the collectivity which are extrinsic and can be objectively measured\n\nReadings\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Durkheim - Division of Labour in Society (Partial) (1893)</a>\n[[Durkheim - What is a Social Fact.pdf]] from The Rules of Sociological Method 1895\nSolidarity\nWhat holds society together?

(Durkheim, 1893, Preface pg. xxvi)\n\nShows Durkheim's belief that morality is very much determined by society of the time\n\nPresentation Prep\nBk 1 Chap 3 p. 68-71, 83-85: Organic Solidarity\n\nOnly the Collective Consciousness has the authority to govern conflicts between its component groups &amp; give binding power to contracts\nIt is precisely because society is interdependent that it is in the Collective Consciousness' interest to legislate Restitutory Laws between groups\n\nRestitutory vs Penal Laws\n\nRepressive Laws are expiatory; They seek the offender to atone for their offence against the Collective Consciousness\nRestitutory Laws aren't expiatory, they attempt to restore as closely to status quo had the law not been broken\nFailure to observe restitutory laws won't make you a social outcast unlike repressive laws\nRestitutory Laws aren't based on Collective Consciousness or are only weakly so\n\nCrimes of Restitutory Laws fail to offend us strongly\nUnlike Repressive Laws, which directly correspond to the strongest moral rules of Common Consciousness\n\nRestitutive Laws tend to create more governing bodies to judge them whereas Repressive Laws can be judged easily by anyone in society\nRestitutive Laws tend not to be of the sort that affects everyone, but only the interactions between two limited groups\n\nYet interdependence means society feels an impact from the conflict; Hence they are governed\n\nLaws as Society's Nervous System\nCriteria for Organic Solidarity\n\nDirect link to society; A link by common sentiment; Mechanical\nLink by interdependence with society's parts; Organic\nPersonality asserted as peculiar characteristics which distinguish us from others\n\ni.e., if youre the same as everyone else, you have no personality\nJ-H: This is a flawed definition\n\nThe strength of mechanical solidarity is inversely proportional to personality\n\nIndividuality cannot arise until the community fills us less completely\n\nWe (supposedly) cannot think for ourselves while thinking like everyone else\n\nWhen mechanical solidarity exerts its effect, our personality disappears and the collective emerges\n\nfor example, a soldier in a regiment\n\nIn mechanical solidarity/segmentary society, the individual belongs to the collective, so personal rights do not exist\nMore specialized\n\nMore dependent\nbut also, more personal, more individuality\nBurden of best practices &lt; burden of collectivist society\n\nMore freedom to experiment &amp; be yourself\n\nIn mechanical solidarity/segmentary society, individual personality is 100% the collective's, while in organic solidarity/organised society, individual personality does exist\nOrganic solidarity is like a higher animal, comprised of specialized organs\n\nThe higher the animal, the greater the inidividualism of its organs, yet the greater the unity\n\nJ-H: All These Analogous Assertions!?!\n\nBk 3 Chap 1 p. 301-306: Anomic Division of Labour\n\nGroups formed by Division of Labour must have predetermined customs for interaction\n\nElse each time they interact, begins a fresh struggle\ni.e., the responsibilities of either party to an agreement, worker benefits\n\nSolidarity isn't to abolish competition but to moderate it; friendly competition vs all-out war\nGoverning customs emerge automatically over time\n\nRepeated or long interactions establish the allocation of rights and duties between two parties\n\nBecomes obligatory even if not written into law\n\nSuch customs arent the cause of interdependence, they are a way interdependence is made concrete\n\nDurkheim is for economic regulation in so far the lack thereof makes obvious disturbances\n\nJ-H: But he refuses to argue for it on grounds he doesnt want to examine it;\nJ-H: Likely its the case effective economic regulation is night impossible to establish\n\nMain Causes of Anomic Division of Labour\n\nInsufficient regulation due to insufficient repetitions or duration of contact\n\nDue to industrializing too fast\n\nLack of organization\nWorking too far apart\nAny other obstacles to communication like consumer fetishism\n\nDurkheim vs Marx on Estranged Labour\n\nEstranged labour is because relationships between capital &amp; labour have been in a legal state of indeterminacy;\n\nLaws on hiring of services occupies very small place in legal codes esp given complexity of employer-employee relations\nThis is smth that should be remedied through law\nFalls under problems caused by insufficient time to form restitutive laws that encourage harmony\n\nConclusion p. 329-341\n\nDivision of Labour is the mechanism to form a Global Government of All Societies united in Interdependence and harmony by all the restitutive laws and custom that keep the peace.\n\nMorality &amp; Division of Labour\n\nUndisputed moral rule: We should follow the essential moral rules of the collective consciousness\n\nIn undeveloped, mechanical, societies, this rule is very restrictive\nIn organic societies, this rule is less restrictive\n\nRule 1: Conformity to the ideas around us/the ideas and sentiments of the Collective Consciousness\n\nWhat else can our own morality be made of but ideas, sentiments &amp; role models around us?\nIn a sense, our morality is shaped by our own interpretation of the Collective Consciousness\n\nThe differences is down to personality\n\nThe purpose of this rule is to prevent the disturbance/offence of the Collective &amp; hence Solidarity\n\nThis only makes sense if the Collective possesses its own morality\n\nWe cannot tolerate violations of the Collective's morality without retribution to prove such violations are inacceptable\n\nRule 2: We should specialize\n\nSpecializing entails becoming different\nAlso is necessary for and serves the purpose of cohesion past some point of society's development\n\nDespite the differences in the two rules, both have their place\nOne characteristic common to all Moral Rules is that they encourage solidarity\n\nLaw, social norms, morality itself, represents the cohesive bonds that bind society together\n\nThe more &amp; stronger such bonds are, the more material/concrete is the morality\n\nAll that is moral are that which forces man to take account of other people\n\nEither by tie of being the same, or being interdependent\n\nMorality is not about being free &amp; independent; Such is a misperception given such ideas stems from society itself\n\nJ-H: Can I not realize society for what it is and choose to be independent? Doesnt mean cause we depended on society for our ideas mean we should continue to be within society\n\nMorality is dependent on society to exist.\n\nWithout social life/interactions, morality would disappear.\nEven duties of the individual to themself are duties to society.\n\nFor example, to maintain your own human dignity\n\nDivision of Labour -&gt; Interdependence -&gt; Cohesion of Society -&gt; Morality\n\nThe Interdependence bonds serve to substitute the now weakened ties of tradition &amp; uniformity.\n\nIt becomes the new foundation for morality\nMechanical ties suffice less and less to keep individuals binded to society\n\nJ-H: Why?\n\nBut there will always be common ideas that will never be lost, like human dignity;\n\nJ-H: Within this set, is where true universal morality lies?\n\nTherefore our duty is to Division of Labour EVEN FURTHER\n\nBut remember, you still follow the essential rules of the collective\n\nDivision of Labour, Organic Solidarity &amp; Freedom\n\nWe are made complete beings by our interdependence on others\n\nLike the beauty of friendship or marriage; No one can be everything alone\n\nThe shift from mechanical to organic solidarity frees the individual from uniformity\n\nDivision of Labour -&gt; Specialization -&gt; Shielding from Uniformity &amp; Caste\n\nUniformity &amp; Caste cannot be enforced when specialization takes priority\n\nBeing whole doesnt mean youre free.\n\nYour personality is a shallow copy of many fields; rather than a unique one forged by deep specialization\n\nJ-H: The goal of interdisciplinary education is to realize new paths inbetween many fields\n\nJ-H: What if I develop myself independent of the pre-existing human wisdoms?\n\nActivities become richer and more intense the more specialised it becomes\n\nJ-H: This is true of only mental/academic Division of Labour thoughâ€¦\n\nSocial Rules of Just Society\n\nThe Solidarity produced by Division of Labour is not directly by interdependence, but the rules &amp; customs entailed by harmonious interdependence\n\nThese rules ensure peace &amp; cooperation between the functions that have been divided up\n\nSociety has a strong interest in whether social rules between organs are formed\n\nThe health/existence of society is dependent on such rules ensuring organs cooperate\nTherefore, society will not let these rules remain indeterminate\nFurthermore, organs will automate define rules anyways\n\nAs Collective Consciousness becomes the Cult of the Individual, it becomes more rational\n\nNo more arbitrary moral rules like staying up late being bad!\nRules:\n\nBe charitable &amp; just to the fellow human\nFulfill our role well\nWork towards a state where everyone's role is what they perform best\nWork towards meritocracy/just rewards for efforts\n\nAppalling Crisis &amp; Its Solutions\n\nWe have changed from segmentary to organised society too fast\n\nOrganic solidarity insufficient time to develop while mechanical solidarity has lost power\nThe new functions/groups due to Division of Labour have yet chance to adjust to each other &amp; form restitutive laws &amp; customs\n\nSo no peace/cooperation/harmony, just competition &amp; negotiation wars\n\nWe are now in a state of Anomic Division of Labour\n\nThe remedy isnt to revive the moral rules (traditions/practices) of the old Collective Consciousness corresponding to mechanical solidarity\n\nIt would be artificial &amp; out of step with the new collective\nDon't be a luddite\n\nSociety is at odds is because the old morality has been irrepairably undermined; but the new morality yet to take shape\nThe solution is to wait as society forms a new morality for itself\n\nThe new morality will arise of its own violition out of necessity, but it is gradual\n\nAll Durkheim has found and proclaims is that the goal of this new morality will always be the same: Solidarity.\n\nJust now it is by interdependence rather than uniformity.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nShould be drawn from main conclusions of each concept\n\nPresented in a succinct form without excess justification or explanation\n\nProvide 1 or 2 case studies to show how these concepts appear in current affairs. Some ideas:\n\nThe NS Act: Common ideas/sentiments, uniformity, mechanical solidarity\nAct 377A: Moral rules of the Collective Consciousness may be arbitrary &amp; serve no utility but to affirm uniformity\nThe Emergence of AI/pretty much any rapid change/industrialization of society and its effects:\n\nCurrently in conflict about the morality of AI art\nAs we speak, discourse is resolving what is and isnt moral\n\nSome of it has even been put into law; like the new copyright laws\n\nActual Takeaways\n\nAll Moral Rules ultimately are to promote Societal Solidarity\nMechanical Solidarity binds its members through common ideas &amp; sentiments\n\nMoral rules, like Repressive Law, revolve around conformity to the Collective Consciousness\n\nOrganic Solidarity binds it members through interdependence\n\nMoral rules, like Restitutive Law, revolve around peace &amp; cooperation between different functional groups of society\n\nAs Society Develops, Division of Labour &amp; the interdependence it brings increasingly substitutes being uniform as the source of Societal Solidarity\nThe specialisation of Division of Labour necessitates society becomes more individualistic as it shifts from reliance on Mechanical to Organic Solidarity\nAnomie arises when society changes from Segmentary to Organised too fast for Organic Solidarity to be formed, meanwhiles Mechanical Solidarity loses power\n\nEstranged Labour is a form of Anomie\nAnomie resolves itself over time as the functional groups of society adjust to each other &amp; new Restitutive Laws are formed\n\nRecitation\nCause of Division of Labour\n\nConcentration of ppls into towns &amp; city -&gt; increased social density\nCompetition more acute due to density -&gt; Necessity of Division of Labour\nDivision of Labour encourages even higher social density due to productivity\nMore interdependent ties over a more dense popular; Higher Dynamic Density, more solidarity/morality compared to diffused solitudinal organic solidarity\n\nForced Division of Labour\n\nDivision of labour but roles are decided based on arbitrary factors like race, religion, caste, etc\nBeing part of a noble family etc\n\nRecommendations\n\nPg 304, covering anomic division of labour, shows Durkheim's apt assessment of social unrest &amp; is highly quotable (according to tutor)\nCan't say Durkheim supports meritocracy; He alluded to the concept in Forced Division of Labour, but meritocracy as a word wasnt invented yet. Have to be clear that he would theoretically support meritocracy or his ideas could essentially be constructed as meritocracy",

Thus the moral ideal, from being the sole one, simple and impersonal, has become increasingly diversified.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 4)\n\n&quot;This is why, noticing that these similarities are very blurred where the functions are very specialised, he saw in this process of disappearanceâ€¦ a threat to social cohesion, due to excessive specialisation.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 301)\n\nFresh Struggle\n\n&quot;The manner in which they should co-operateâ€¦ must be predetermined. Otherwise, a fresh struggle would be required each time in order to bring them into a state of equilibrium with one anotherâ€¦&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 301)\n\nFrequent Interaction\n\n&quot;the conditions for this equilibrium can only be found by a process of trial and errorâ€¦&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 301)\n\n&quot;â€¦there exists a certain allocation of rights and duties that is established by usage and that ends up by becoming obligatory.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 302)\n\n&quot;â€¦a state of anomie is impossible wherever organs solidly linked to one another are in sufficient contactâ€¦ being adjacent to one another, they are easily alerted in every situation to the enedd for one another and consequently they experience a keen, continuous feeling of their mutual dependence.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 304)\n\nToo Fast\n\n&quot;Thus the morality corresponding to [mechanical] society has lost influence, but without its successor developing quickly enough to occupy the space left vacant in our consciousness.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 339)\n\n&quot;On the other hand, the functions that have been disrupted in this period of trial have had no time to adjust to one another.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 339)\n\n&quot;certain elements of this morality have been irretrievably undermined, and the morality we require is only in the process of taking shape.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 340)\n\nResolution\n\n&quot;Above all, it has not been organised so as to satisfy the need for justice that has been aroused even more passionately in our hearts.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 339)\n\n&quot;find ways of harmonious co-operation between those organs that still clash discordantly together.

If the ideal is to create for ourselves a special, personal image, this cannot mean to be like everyone else.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 84)\n\nInverse Proportionality\n\n&quot;The solidarity that derives from similarities is at its maximum when the collective consciousness completely envelops our total consciousness, coinciding with it at every point. At that moment our individuality is zero.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 84)\n\n&quot;at the very moment when [mechanical] solidarity exerts its effect, our personality, it may be said by definition, disappears, for we are no longer ourselves, but a collective being.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 84)\n\nSpecialisation is Personality\n\n&quot;The situation is entirely different in the case of solidarity that brings about the division of labourâ€¦ is only possible if each one of us has a sphere of action that is peculiarly our own, and consequently a personality. Thus the collective consciousness leaves uncovered a part of the individual consciousness, so that there may be established in it those special functions that it cannot regulate.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 85)\n\n&quot;â€¦the activity of each one of us is correspondingly more specialised, the more personal it is.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 85)\n\nLiberating Effect\n\n&quot;The division of labour itself contributes to this liberating effect. Individual natures become more complex through specialising; by this very fact they are partly shielded against the effects of the collectivity and the influences of heredity, which can scarcely enforce themselves except in simple, general matters.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 335)\n\nSee Also",

(Durkheim, 1893, pg 21)\n\nWhat is Organic Solidarity\n\n&quot;the society to which we are solidly joined is a system of different and special functions united by definite relationships.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 83)\n\n&quot;that network of ties that gradually becomes woven of its own accord and that makes organic solidarity something that is permanent.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, 303)\n\nCult of the Individual\n\n&quot;â€¦the collective consciousness is increasingly reduced to the cult of the individual, we shall see that the characteristic of morality in organised societies, as compared to segmentary societies, is that it posesses something more human, and consequently more rational, about it.&quot; (Durkheim, 1893, pg 338)\n\nSee Also",
